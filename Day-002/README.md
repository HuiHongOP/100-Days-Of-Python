# Day 2 Understanding Data Types and How to Manipulate Strings

### Lesson:
> Data Types: String, Integer, Float, Boolean
```
Ex: String 
"This is a string"

Ex: Integer is number without decimal place. Make sure there's no quote or else treated as string
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,...

Ex: Float. Make sure there's no quote or else treated as string

1.31,78.41,89.33,3.14159,....

Ex: Boolean
True, False
```

* Use ```_``` to replace ```,``` in larger number such as bank balance. Ex 300,000,000 to 300_300_300. That would be a big amount of numbers. 😝


**_NOTE_:** Be careful converting string to float or int. You can't convert "hello" to int or float.
* ```type()``` -> place a variable inside the function to check the data type
* ```int()``` -> convert string and float into integer
* ```str()``` -> convert float and int into string
* ```float``` -> convert int and string into float
* Mathematical operations read from left to right
* Can't concatenate string with int
* Using f string to print is more convenient ```print(f "The score is: {number})"```
