# Day 1

## Topic:
``` Printing, Commenting, Debugging, String Manipluation, and Variables```

### Printing: 
The function ```print()`` allow the display a message to the console.
```
Ex. 
print("Hello World!")

Output: Hello World!
```

### Commenting:
To comment a line in python editor. You will be using the "#" known as the hashtag. 
> **_NOTE:_** Python will ignore the comments.

Ex.
```
#This is a comment line. Single line comment
print("Hello World!")

Output: Hello World!


#This 
#is 
#multiline comments
print("Hello World!")

Output: Hello World!


"""
This is known as triple double quotes. It comments everything
inside here.
"""
print("Hello World!")

Output: Hello World!

```

### Debugging:
Debug is a simple yet hard process to find the root causes of a problem in the code. The best practice is to use the function to print() to debug your code or use Stack OverFlow.

### String Manipluation: 
String manipluation is a way to change or alter the current string into a specific new value/string.
```

Ex.
This convert the string of "new york" into all capitalized "NEW YORK"

upperCase = "new york".upper()
print(upperCase)

Output: NEW YORK
```

### Variables:
A variable is a name that reference to an object. A variable is responsible for data values.

```
Ex. 

name = "Jason"
year = 2023
isFriday = False

In the above, "name", "year", and "isFriday" are all variables.

"name" is a string variable.
"year" is a integer variable.
"isFriday" is a boolean variable.
```
