## 🗒️ About
```
Hello, my name is Hui Hong(Jason). I have started my journey on 100 days of Python.  This course consists of 100 projects from beginner to professional. I highly recommened to anyone who wanted to learn to become a python programmer.
```

I will try to post all the exercises and activities that I would be doing in the course. However, some of the exercises wouldn't be posted here due to the assignments/exercises are in a classroom environment. Therefore, it would be best of your interest to buy the course and get access to all of the exercises and resources.

Each day will contain a readme.md that will explain the topic with examples and resources.
